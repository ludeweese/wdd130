    <p>Hello! My name is Lucilene DeWeese. All my friends know me as Lucy. I am originally from Brazil, but I have been living in Atlanta, Georgia for a while.</p>
         <p>I am marriage for 13 years to Benjamin and we have two little boys and a baby girl. </p>
         <p>I'm a Web Design and Development major, a photographer in my "spare" time and I am a full-time mother.</p>
         <p>I love crafts, reading, and having parties. I often find a reason to celebrate and gather together with family and friends. </p>
         <p>During the pandemic I discovered two new passions: drawing cartoons and meditation. </p>
         <p>I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter- day Saints since the year of 2000. I was 16 years old when the missionaries found me and my friends to teach the gospel. My life has changed forever! </p>
        <p>I am looking forward to get to know you guys this semester!</p>
